### Inhalation health benchmarks (IHBs) {#IHBs}

The inhalation health benchmarks used by MPCA programs are available online:

- [PDF](https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/aq9-28.pdf) 
- [Excel](https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/aq9-22.xlsm)
- [CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MPCA-air/health-values/master/Inhalation_Health_Benchmarks(IHBs).csv)


### Air Quality Standards (NAAQs and MAAQS) {#NAAQS}
Criteria air pollutants including: particulate (TSP, PM10, PM2.5), ozone, lead, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide are regulated via ambient air quality standards. Ambient air quality standards are set at the national (NAAQS) and state (MAAQS) level. 


__NAAQS__

The Clean Air Act, which was last amended in 1990, requires EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (40 CFR part 50) for pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. The Clean Air Act identifies two types of national ambient air quality standards. Primary standards provide public health protection, including protecting the health of "sensitive" populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards provide public welfare protection, including protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings.

- A summary of current NAAQS is available on EPA's website:
    - https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table
- When calculating NAAQS design values, analysts must follow the procedures defined in the pollutant specific [appendices to 40 CFR 50](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c118ce8b63f65737a282c4281a59abf0&mc=true&node=pt40.2.50&rgn=div5).
- In August each year, EPA posts official design values here:

__MAAQS__

Minnesota Ambient Air Quality Standards (MAAQS) are established in [Minnesota Administrative Rules 7009](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules?id=7009&keyword_type=all&keyword=7009&keyword_sg=rule&redirect=0).

In most cases, the MAAQS are the same as the NAAQS. The MAAQS also include standards for two pollutants that are not covered by the NAAQS: TSP and Hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The MAAQS were last updated in January 2017.

When calculating MAAQS design values:

- If `MAAQS = NAAQS`, use methods described in appendices to 40 CFR 50.
- If `MAAQS = revoked NAAQS`, use methods described in archived appendices to 40 CFR 50.
- For MAAQS without a NAAQS, such as H2S, use the "Form of the standard" language to guide your calculations.
